# image-plot

The goal of this repository is to streamline the task of ploting an image as a
surface in python.

## Functionality

This tool is designed to be used in Jupyter Notebooks. The function `plot` in the `image-plot` module takes an image file name in the current directory, reads the image with OpenCV, and plots it as a surface in 3D space using the `mplot3D` toolkit from `mpl_toolkits`.
