# blitz

The goal of this repository is to streamline the task of plotting an image as a
surface in python.

## Functionality

The function `plot` in the `blitz` module takes an image and plots it as a surface in 3D space using the `mplot3D` toolkit from `mpl_toolkits`.

### Todo

- Increase code efficiency and speed
- Publish `blitz` with [PyPi](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
